# About This Project

This site was built with a focus on first principles and transparency, using:

- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Markdown for content
- Vite for fast building and development

## Philosophy

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, understandable architecture that gives you the benefits of both markdown-driven content and the interactivity of React components.

By avoiding unnecessary abstraction and "magic" frameworks, this site gives you complete control over how everything works, while still providing a pleasant development experience.

## Extending This Site

You can easily extend this site by:

1. Adding new markdown files to `public/content/pages/`
2. Updating the navigation in `public/content/site-structure.json`
3. Creating interactive React components where needed

All the code is straightforward and transparent, so you can modify it to suit your specific needs.
