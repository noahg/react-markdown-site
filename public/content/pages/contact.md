## Example Contact Form

To add an interactive contact form here, you would:

1. Create a React component for the form
2. Import and use it in a special version of the MarkdownRenderer that supports React components in Markdown
3. Handle form submission either client-side or to a backend API

This demonstrates how you can mix markdown content with interactive React components where needed.
